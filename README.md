# pbfilter

pbfilter is a set of utilities for filtering Pacific Biosciences
sequencing data. This package was extracted from the
SMRTAnalysis 2.3.0 distribution at
http://www.pacb.com/support/software-downloads/

# Notes

The only change made here is that the ".py" suffix has been removed
from the script names.
